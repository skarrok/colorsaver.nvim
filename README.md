# colorsaver.nvim

colorsaver.nvim is a Neovim plugin designed to save and load your preferred
colorscheme persistently across sessions. With colorsaver, you can ensure your
aesthetic preferences are maintained automatically. Additionally, it can
automatically load colorscheme changes across all running instances of Neovim,
providing a consistent user experience.

## Features

- **Persistent Colorscheme**: Save your selected colorscheme and have it load
automatically on startup.
- **Automatic Updates**: Watch for changes and automatically apply them across
instances of Neovim.

## Installation

Install colorsaver using your favorite package manager.

### [lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) (recommended)

```lua
{
  "https://git.sr.ht/~swaits/colorsaver.nvim",
  lazy = true,
  event = "VimEnter",
  opts = { 
    -- your options here
  },
}
```

Or, using [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/), which is built on top of
[lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim), one example configuration might
look like this:

```lua
  {
    -- tell LazyVim to stop messing with colorschemes
    { "catppuccin/nvim", name = "catppuccin", enabled = false },
    { "folke/tokyonight.nvim", enabled = false },
    {
      "LazyVim/LazyVim",
      opts = {
        colorscheme = "default", -- just some random built-in scheme
      },
    },


    -- load/save our last used colorscheme automatically
    {
      "https://git.sr.ht/~swaits/colorsaver.nvim",
      event = "VimEnter",
      opts = {},
      dependencies = {
        -- load colorschemes as a dependency of colorsaver
        { "AlexvZyl/nordic.nvim" },
        { "EdenEast/nightfox.nvim" },
        { "Shatur/neovim-ayu" },
        { "rebelot/kanagawa.nvim" },
      },
    },
  }

```

### [pckr](https://github.com/lewis6991/pckr.nvim)

```lua
{
  "https://git.sr.ht/~swaits/colorsaver.nvim",
  config = function()
    require("colorsaver").setup({ 
      -- your options here
    })
  end
}
```

### [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

```vim
Plug 'https://git.sr.ht/~swaits/colorsaver.nvim'
lua require("colorsaver").setup({ 
    -- your options here
})
```

## Configuration

To configure colorsaver, pass a table with your preferred settings to the
`setup` function. Here is the default configuration:

```lua
{
  -- log_level: Sets the logging level for the module's output.
  -- Acceptable values are "debug", "info", "warn", "error".
  log_level = "warn",

  -- debounce_ms: Sets the debounce time in milliseconds for file watching.
  -- Accepts any integer greater than or equal to 50. If experiencing issues,
  -- consider increasing this value.
  debounce_ms = 100,

  -- filename: The name of the file where the colorscheme will be saved.
  -- Note that the file is always stored in the "data" directory, which is
  -- usually ~/.local/share/nvim/
  filename = "colorsaver",

  -- auto_load: If true, any colorscheme changes from one instance of nvim
  -- will be automatically loaded by all other instances of nvim.
  auto_load = true,
}
```

### File Watching

If `auto_load` is enabled, colorsaver will watch for changes in the saved
colorscheme file and apply them to all running instances of Neovim.

### Logging

colorsaver features an integrated logging system. You can specify the log level
in the configuration options. For troubleshooting, set the `log_level` to
`"debug"` to receive verbose output.

## Usage

Once colorsaver is installed and configured, it works automatically. Your
current colorscheme will be saved upon change and reloaded when Neovim starts
or when any Neovim instance changes it (when `auto_load` is `true`).

## Similar Projects

Before creating this, I used
[last-color.nvim](https://github.com/raddari/last-color.nvim). It's fantastic.

But I wanted to take it a step further. Specifically, I often run multiple nvim
instances in my terminal multiplexer. When I change colors in one, I wanted all
the others to change too. That was my main goal here.

It also adds some other niceties, like debouncing to avoid problems when
switching colorschemes too quickly (as is easy to do when browsing through
schemes with Telescope).

That said, they both work. Use what works best for you!
